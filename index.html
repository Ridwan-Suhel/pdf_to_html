            <p>Did you know that over 60&#37; of all fires start in electrical mains, or because of an electrical short? And even those fires that start elsewhere eventually result in a failure of electricity, because of damage to the mains and wiring.</p>

            <p>Which means that in a fire situation, you can be sure that at some point, the entire premises will be plunged into darkness.</p>

            <p>Noxious black smoke will fill the air, increasing the risk of asphyxiation for all in the area. A frightening scenario when you consider the fact that asphyxiation and smoke poisoning are the highest causes of casualties in any fire.</p>

            <p>Darkness and poisonous smoke. A sure recipe for panic and utter chaos.</p>

            <p>In such a situation, the single most important need of the hour is to evacuate all those on the premises to the nearest point of safety. As efficiently and quickly as possible.</p>

            <p>And Ceasefire, quite literally, shows you the way.</p>

            <h2>Introducing the Ceasefire System for Emergency Evacuation (Ceasefire SEE). Your Path to Safety </h2>

            <p>Ceasefire’s photoluminescent signs shine brightly through smoke and darkness, showing the route to the nearest exit, pointing you to emergency equipment and clearly marking all safe exits.</p>

            <p>The range contained in Ceasefire SEE is comprehensive, covering every possible evacuation need:</p>

            <ol type="1">
                <li>Fire Safety Signs</li>

                <li>Evacuation Plans</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Each of these signs serves a critical function, as you will see below. </p>

            <p>In case of a fire, the firefighting equipment on the premises needs to be located and activated quickly. Ceasefire Fire Safety Signs help guide people to the nearest extinguishers, hosepipes, emergency alarms and so on.</p>

            <p>The fact is, you never know where you may be when fire strikes and results in pitch darkness. You could be far from your cabin, in an unfamiliar part of the premises.</p>

            <p>Ceasefire’s Escape Route Signs ensure that from any point on the premises, occupants will have clear directions to the closest safe exit in case of an emergency.</p>

            <p>Marking strips are critical in areas that need special navigation in the dark, such as around pillars, corners, low-lying or protruding objects, heavy machines etc. These floor-mounted strips glow brightly, to guide occupants on a safe, obstructionfree path to the nearest exit.</p>

            <p>Dense, black smoke from fires makes visibility harder than one can imagine. As the smoke rises, it can make even fire escape signs difficult to spot at a distance. This can hamper evacuation and firefighting.</p>

            <p>The Low-Level Signage System is a comprehensive solution to this problem.</p>

            <p>These durable, high-grade photoluminescent strips run throughout the premises, leading you to fire escapes, fire extinguisher locators, assembly points and evacuation routes. They complement, and can incorporate the entire range of Ceasefire SEE fire safety and escape route signs.</p>

            <p>The Low-Level Signage System follows a simple principle: as smoke rises, it becomes easier to see at a lower level. Therefore, installing these strips along the floor, and on walls at a height of 0.4 metres or less, makes them instantly visible. Even if the area is full of smoke. The Ceasefire Design Cell helps in this process by surveying the entire location for obstructions, alternative exits and other contingencies, and customising the system for the location. A team of specialised engineers then installs the system, without disrupting the normal functioning of the facility. So you don't have downtime or panic. Just a clear path to safety </p>

            <p>In densely populated areas such as schools, factories, hotels, cinemas etc.,with cubicles and complex layouts, it is extremely important to have an effective evacuation plan. In case of a fire, this plan could literally be the difference between tragedy and hundreds of lives saved.</p>

            <p>And as with any life saving device, an evacuation plan is not something that can be bought across the counter and utilized in any fashion. It requires careful planning and assessment by experts, to maximise both safety and efficiency of evacuation in an emergency.</p>

            <p>The team at Ceasefire puts together meticulous evacuation plans only after carefully inspecting the premises, taking into consideration all the disparate factors that come into play if a fire breaks out.</p>
